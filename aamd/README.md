###### AUAUST TOOLS — InDesign — Custom synthax highlighting for AUAUST Markdown

## About

A Language Extension to highlight AUAUST Markdown syntax, which is a Markdown dialect used by AUAUST's InDesign GENERATE script.
It's 95% alike the original Markdown syntax, but with some additions and changes to make it more suitable for AUAUST's needs.

It also deduplicates some of the original Markdown syntax, to make it more readable and easier to use. An exemple of that is italic and strong, which in original Markdown are written like this: `*italic*` and `**strong**` with support for `_` and `__` in some implementations. In AUAUST Markdown, they are always and only written like this: `__italic__` and `**strong**`.
